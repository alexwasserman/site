## Reliability is hard. But you're not in it alone.
This group brings together operations and development engineers from different organizations to discuss challenges and solutions around engineering for reliability. Share successes and failures, learn about best practices, and meet others who are also on a journey to implement a sustainable practice of reliability engineering.

### Format

* Monthly sessions via Google Meet -- all are welcome!
* We use a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) format where discussion topics are generated by the group

Also, [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/reliability-discuss) is available any time for asynchronous discussion.

### Topics
This group is what its members make it--whatever is of interest to the group is fair game! But here are some of the kinds of things we expect will be on the table:

* Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and other approaches to building and maintaining reliable systems
* Monitoring, observability, and incident response
* Toil: identifying and reducing it
* Service Level Indicators and Objectives (SLIs/SLOs)
* Culture change, blamelessness, communication

#### Is this group only for GCP users?
No! Anyone is welcome, and most topics within reliability engineering are platform-agnostic.
